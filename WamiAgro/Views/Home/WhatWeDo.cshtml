                    <p>
                        Wami Credit supplies farmers with seeds, tools, and fertiliser via Village Savings and Loan
                        Associations (VSLAs) that fund farmers with little to no access to commercial bank credit.
                        WamiAgro takes repayment of its loans via the commercial sales of a farmer’s crop.
